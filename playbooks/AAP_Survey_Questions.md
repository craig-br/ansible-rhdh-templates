## Implementation Guidelines

### Setting Up Surveys in AAP

1. **Navigate to Job Templates**
   - Go to Resources → Templates
   - Select your job template
   - Click "Edit"

2. **Enable Survey**
   - Check "Prompt on Launch" for Survey
   - Click "Add Survey"

3. **Add Questions**
   - Use the survey questions provided above
   - Copy the exact variable names to ensure compatibility
   - Set appropriate validation rules

4. **Test Survey**
   - Save and launch the job template
   - Verify all survey questions appear correctly
   - Test with different input combinations

### Variable Mapping

Ensure these survey variables map correctly to your playbook variables:

**System Info Template:**
- `target_user` → playbook `target_user`
- `log_file_path` → playbook `log_file_path`
- `include_processes` → playbook `include_processes`
- `include_network` → playbook `include_network`

**File Operations Template:**
- `operation_type` → playbook `operation_type`
- `source_path` → playbook `source_path`
- `destination_path` → playbook `destination_path`
- `file_permissions` → playbook `file_permissions`
- `search_pattern` → playbook `search_pattern`
- `search_directory` → playbook `search_directory`
- `file_content` → playbook `file_content`

## Best Practices

### Security Considerations
1. **Path Validation**: Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal attacks
2. **Permission Restrictions**: Limit available permission options for security
3. **User Confirmation**: Require explicit confirmation for destructive operations
4. **Backup Strategy**: Always recommend backups for production systems

### User Experience
1. **Clear Labels**: Use descriptive choice labels that explain the impact
2. **Helpful Defaults**: Provide safe, commonly-used default values
3. **Contextual Help**: Include help text explaining when each option is used
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Consider conditional survey questions for complex workflows

### Operational Guidelines
1. **Testing**: Always test surveys in a development environment first
2. **Documentation**: Keep this document updated when playbooks change
3. **Validation**: Implement input validation in both surveys and playbooks
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor job execution logs for survey-related issues

### Error Handling
1. **Input Validation**: Validate survey inputs in playbooks
2. **Graceful Failures**: Handle invalid inputs gracefully with clear error messages
3. **Rollback Procedures**: Document rollback procedures for failed operations
4. **Audit Trail**: Maintain logs of all file operations for compliance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Variable Name Mismatch**: Ensure survey variable names exactly match playbook variables
2. **Permission Errors**: Verify target systems have appropriate permissions
3. **Path Issues**: Check that specified paths exist and are accessible
4. **Network Connectivity**: Ensure AAP can reach target systems

### Support Information
- **Playbook Location**: `/playbooks/` directory in this repository
- **Documentation**: This file (`AAP_Survey_Questions.md`)
- **Version**: Compatible with AAP 2.x and Ansible Core 2.12+
